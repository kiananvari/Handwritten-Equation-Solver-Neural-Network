# Project Title

Equation Solver!

Implementing a neural network that recognizes handwritten equations on paper and solves them

The dataset has been prepared from the handwriting of different people and they have been Annotated using the Roboflow tool.

You can see the dataset in the documentation file.

Equations are detected by Detectron2 Tool using Faster R-CNN and Hierarchical Clustering.

For more information about this project, please read the documentation file.
